<h2>HTML5 Audio API</h2>

<h3>Enabling Audio support</h3>

For security reasons, before the Autotip extension will pickup tips from audio
elements using this API, you must first enable Autotip's "Audio Mode". This is done
by adding the "Audio Microtip" tag onto the page:

    <pre><code>
        &lt;meta name="mcrotip" content="audio">
    </code></pre>

You can use the Audio Microtip tag in conjunction with normal microtip meta tags:

<pre><code>
    &lt;meta name="microtip" content="1K65TijR56S4CcwjXBnecYEKmTNrMag5uq">
    &lt;meta name="microtip" content="audio">
</code></pre>

In this case, the first tag tells Autotip how to tip the page creators, and the second
microtip tag tells the audio

<h3>Specifying Tip addresses and tip recipients for songs</h3>

In the body of the document, there will be an audio element where the user can listen
to your song. Inside the body of theaudio element, place a JSON encoded list of tips:

<pre><code>
    &lt;audio src="http://musicstation.tips.s3.amazonaws.com/08_Free_Four.mp3" controls>
        [{address: "1F4xND22B7qxDtPoGDBLXaxGKXPCyV1c4T"}]
    &lt;/audio>
</code></pre>

Note: Even if there is only one tip address (as is the most often case), that tip
must be defined as a one element list.

Just like with the meta tag speficifation, extra attributes can be defined:

<pre><code>
    &lt;audio src="http://musicstation.tips.s3.amazonaws.com/08_Free_Four.mp3" controls>
        [
            {
                address: "1F4xND22B7qxDtPoGDBLXaxGKXPCyV1c4T",
                recipient: "Pink Floyd",
                ratio: 0.75
            },
            {
                address: "1K65TijR56S4CcwjXBnecYEKmTNrMag5uq",
                recipient: "Pink Floyd's Management",
                ratio: 0.25
            }
        ]
    &lt;/audio>
</code></pre>

This is technically against the HTML specification, since audio elements are supposed
to be "block only" elements. This method was chosen for version 1.0 of this API
because of limitations of the chrome extension api.


<h3>Actual Example</h3>

The following media element is sourced by the code listed above:

<audio src="http://musicstation.tips.s3.amazonaws.com/08_Free_Four.mp3" controls>
    [{address: "1F4xND22B7qxDtPoGDBLXaxGKXPCyV1c4T", recipient: "Pink Floyd (from the autotip examples page)"}]
</audio>

If you have Autotip installed...

You should see the yellow music icon in the address box.

Press the play button and hear the music. When the song ends, the chrome extension will
pick up the meta tags, and you'll be able to see them in the popup. Click the yellow music
icon to see the popup. Inside the popup you'll see a green button. Clicking on that green button
will send bitcoin to the recipient.
